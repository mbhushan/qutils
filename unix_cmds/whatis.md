#####  whatis: One-Line Command Summaries
whatis is almost identical to apropos or the use of man -k, but it requires a command name as an argument -- rather than an arbitrary string. 

**whatis (cmd_name)** gives you a nice one-line summary:
``` sh
$ whatis cat
cat (1)     - concatenate files and print on the standard output

$ whatis ps
ps (1)               - report a snapshot of the current processes.

$ whatis find
find (1)             - search for files in a directory hierarchy

whatis grep
grep (1)             - print lines matching a pattern
```
