#####  Who's On?
The who command lists the users logged on to the system now. Here's an example of the output on my system:
``` sh
$ who
mani     :0           2015-01-13 20:00 (:0)
mani     pts/3        2015-01-14 10:16 (:0)
mani     pts/15       2015-01-14 10:18 (:0)
mani     pts/16       2015-01-15 11:55 (:0)
mani     pts/17       2015-01-17 19:42 (:0)
mani     pts/19       2015-01-16 11:44 (:0)
```

Each line shows a different terminal or window. The columns show the username logged on, the tty number and the login time.
