#####  The info Command
Unlike man -- which displays all information on a topic at once, usually routed through some form of paging system such as cat -- info is based on a hypertext like linkage between topic components. You connect to each of the subtopics using character-based commands and typing part or all of the subtopic title -- at least enough to distinguish one subtopic from another.

Below is the first page of cmd: **$ info grep**
``` sh
$ info grep
File: grep.info,  Node: Top,  Next: Introduction,  Up: (dir)
